  <h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

  <p>The FreeBSD/ia64 project pages contain information about the FreeBSD
    port to Intel's IA-64 architecture; officially known as the Intel Itanium&reg;
    Processor Family (IPF). As with the port itself, these pages are still
    mostly a work in progress.
    </p>

  <h3><a name="status">Current status</a></h3>

  <p>The ia64 port is still considered a tier 2 platform. This boils down
    to not being fully supported by our security officer, release engineers
    and toolchain maintainers. In practice however the distinction between
    a tier 1 platform (which is fully supported) and a tier 2 platform is not
    as strict as it seems. In almost all aspects the ia64 port is a tier 1
    platform.<br>
    From a developer point of view there's an advantage to have the ia64
    port be a tier 2 platform for a while longer. We still have a couple
    of ABI breaking changes in the pipeline and having to maintain backward
    compatibility this early in a ports life is less than ideal.</p>
