	    <p><b>How do I get GNOME &gnomever; for FreeBSD?</b></p>
<!-- A1 -->
	    <p>There are two ways to install GNOME &gnomever; on FreeBSD.  One way is to use 
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/packages-using.html">
	        packages</a>, and the other way is to use
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
	        ports</a>.  Before doing either installation, you should
		first familiarize yourself with the GNOME &gnomever;
		<a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/&gnomever;/notes/">
		release notes</a>.</p>

	    <p>To install GNOME &gnomever; from packages, use the command:</p>

	    <tt># pkg_add -r gnome2</tt>

	    <p>This will download the latest GNOME &gnomever; packages from the 
	      FreeBSD FTP site, and proceed to install them on your system.
	    </p>

	    <p>To build and install GNOME &gnomever; from ports, you should first 
	      <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">
	        cvsup</a> the latest ports tree.  Then:</p>

	    <pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>For the best GNOME &gnomever; experience, you should install from
	      ports, after adding the following macros to your 
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> file:</p>

	    <pre>
WITH_FAM=	yes
WITH_LAME=	yes
	    </pre>

	    <p><tt>WITH_FAM</tt> enables file alteration manager support
	      which allows Nautilus to update its file lists in real-time
	      as well as allows all GNOME components to detect config
	      file changes without needing to restart GNOME.  Note that
	      for FAM to work properly, you also need to add the following
	      to <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> then reboot:</p>

	      <p>For FreeBSD 4.x:<br>
	        <tt>portmap_enable="YES"</tt>
	      </p>

	      <p>For FreeBSD 5.x:<br>
	        <tt>rpcbind_enable="YES"</tt>
	      </p>

	      <p><tt>WITH_LAME</tt> adds MP3 support, enabling you to play
	      MP3s directly in Nautilus.</p>

	    <p>These options may cause build errors on certain platforms, and
	      thus they are not enabled by default.</p>

	    <p>Once you have the GNOME &gnomever; desktop installed,
	      GNOME &gnomever; can be started by adding the following line
	      to <tt>~/.xsession</tt> or <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt>, as appropriate:</p>

	    <pre>
exec gnome-session
	    </pre>

	    </li>

            <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q2"></a>
	    <p><b>GNOME &gnomever; is failing to build from ports.  What do I do?</b></p>
<!-- A2 -->
	    <p>The majority of GNOME &gnomever; compilation problems can be solved 
	      by making sure all the necessary GNOME &gnomever; components are 
	      <a href="#q6">up-to-date</a>.</p>
	      
	    <p>In general, when a GNOME &gnomever; component is not up-to-date,
	      you will see an error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
checking for libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0 libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1
gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2 libglade-2.0... 
configure: error: Library requirements (libgnomeui-2.0 libbonoboui-2.0
libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.2.1 gnome-vfs-2.0 libgnomeprint-2.2 >= 2.3.0 libgnomeprintui-2.2
libglade-2.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
	      </pre>
	      
	    <p>Simply keeping your ports tree <a href="#q6">up-to-date</a> will
	      prevent these errors.</p>
	      
	    <p>If the <tt>pkg-config</tt> program is out-of-date, you may see
	      a configure error similar to the following:</p>

	      <pre>
configure: error: *** pkg-config too old; version 0.14 or better required.
	      </pre>

	      <p>While this may be buried in some other text, the error is
	        very straight-forward: you need to upgrade pkg-config.
		The pkg-config application is found in the 
		<tt>devel/pkgconfig</tt> port.  By updating this port to
		the latest version, this error will go away.</p>
	      
	      <p>You may see compiler errors relating to pthreads 
	      (&posix; threads), such as:</p>

	    <pre>
undefined reference to 'strerror_r'
            </pre>

	    <p>To fix thread related errors, make sure you have the following
	      compiled into your kernel:</p>

	    <pre>
options     _KPOSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING
            </pre>

	    <p>If you are tracking -stable or -current, make sure that you
	      do <b>not</b> have <tt>NOLIBC_R</tt> set in 
	      <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>. If you do, remove it, then rebuild world.
	      If you still have trouble, please send email to 
	      <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">
	      &email;@FreeBSD.org</a> with the output of the failed compilation.
	      It is also helpful to include the config.log from the port's
	      work directory.</p>

	    <p>Ports such as <tt>devel/pth</tt> and <tt>devel/ngpt</tt> can
	      also cause pthread-related problems when compiling GNOME &gnomever;.
	      If you do not need these ports installed, it is recommended that
	      you remove them.
	    </p>

		<p>A common source of build failures is the existence of multiple versions
		  of the same library.  This can happen if you have two different versions of
		  a port installed, or can even happen through normal <tt>portupgrade</tt> use.
		  You can back up the libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib/compat/pkg</tt> and remove
		  them, and then run <tt>portupgrade -u -rf pkgconfig</tt>.  This will force a
		  rebuild of all GNOME-related apps (and a fair number of other apps) without
		  retaining old versions of libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib/compat/pkg</tt>.

	    <p><b>I installed GNOME &gnomever;, but I am missing application foo.
	      What gives?</b></p>
<!-- A3 -->
	    <p>Only the core components, and a few extras, are included in the
	      <tt>gnome2</tt> package.  While you can still run 
	      <a href="#q7">GNOME 1.4 applications</a> under GNOME &gnomever;,
	      a number of applications have already been ported to
	      GNOME &gnomever;.</p>

	    <p>The applications that have been ported are included 
	      in the <tt>gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> meta-port.  
	      Note, some of these applications are still in the early 
	      development stages, and may not be very stable.</p>

	    <p>To install <tt>gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> from packages:</p>

            <pre>
# pkg_add -r gnome2-fifth-toe
            </pre>

	    <p>To install <tt>gnome2-fifth-toe</tt> from ports:</p>

	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME 1.4 to GNOME 2?</b></p>
<!-- A4 -->
	    <p>If you have
	      GNOME 1.4, and you want to upgrade to GNOME &gnomever;, first
	      familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.0/installation.html#upgrading">official</a> upgrade instructions from
	      the GNOME site.  Make sure your GNOME 1.4 ports are
	      up-to-date, and then remove the following GNOME 1.4 packages from
	      the system:</p>
	    
	    <pre>
gnomecore
sawfish
gnomeapplets 
gnomemedia
gtop
libgtop
nautilus
gedit
xalf
bugbuddy
gnomeaudio
gnomegames
gnomeutils
gdm
eog
ggv
	   </pre>

	   <p>After those packages are removed, you can build GNOME &gnomever; as per 
	     the <a href="#q1">instructions listed above</a>.</p>

	  </li>

<!-- Q5 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q5"></a>
	    <p><b>What is the best way to upgrade from GNOME 2.2 to GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A5 -->
	    <p>We recommend that you use <tt>/usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade</tt>
	      for this purpose.  The following will do the job well:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkgdb -F
(answer yes to all prompts; note that you might wish
to run the above command after each step below)
# portupgrade ORBit2 libbonobo
# portupgrade -rf -m BATCH=yes atk
# portupgrade -R -m BATCH=yes gnome2
	    </pre>

	  </li>

<!-- Q6 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q6"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I keep my GNOME &gnomever; components and applications 
	      up-to-date?</b></p>
<!-- A6 -->
	    <p>I find that <tt>/usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade</tt> works really
	      well.  For example:</p>

	    <tt># portupgrade -r pkgconfig</tt>

	    <p>This will upgrade pkgconfig and every other port that depends 
	      on it (that needs updating).</p>

	    <p>However, sometimes so much changes that it becomes 
	      necessary to do a little housekeeping first. In that case, this 
	      usually works:</p>

	    <pre>
# pkg_delete -rf pkgconfig\*
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome2
# make clean
# make install clean
	    </pre>

	    <p>These steps will remove <b>all</b> the GNOME 1 and 2 components 
	      and applications from your machine, but only reinstalls the
	      GNOME 2 desktop.  You should be aware, that if it comes to
	      this, you will need to reinstall your applications after 
	      reinstalling the desktop.  Fortunately, this extreme measure
	      is only rarely needed.
	    </p>

<!-- Q7 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q7"></a>
	    <p><b>Can I install GNOME 1.4 applications under GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A7 -->
	    <p>GNOME 1.4 ports will run well under the GNOME 2 desktop. Older
	      applications that were incompatible with the GNOME 2 desktop
	      have been removed from the ports tree, so it should be safe to
	      run any GNOME application in the ports tree under the GNOME 2
	      desktop.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q8 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q8"></a>
	    <p><b>Where can I get more themes for GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A8 -->
	    <p>The website <a href="http://art.gnome.org"> 
	      art.gnome.org</a> has been setup as a general GNOME theme
	      repository.  They offer some gtk+-2, metacity, sawfish,
	      nautilus, icon, and gdm themes, as well as some backgrounds.</p>

	    <p>A new theme site called <a href="http://www.themedepot.org">
	      The Theme Depot</a> has just been launched.  This site contains
	      themes for GNOME 2 as well as KDE and quite a few window
	      managers.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>Freshmeat.net has a themes archive at
	      <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net">themes.freshmeat.net</a>,
	      which contains themes and backgrounds for many window managers,
	      theme engines, and desktop environments.  This site grew out of
	      the old themes.org.
	    </p>

	    <p>A good site for some cool GNOME icons (some stock, some new)
	      is jimmac's <a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/ikony.php3"> 
	      Icons</a> site.</p>

	    <p>See the instructions on the website for installing the themes.
	      If you feel inclined to port a few of them, you will not be
	      turned away ;-).</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q9 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q9"></a>
	    <p><b>What window managers work well with GNOME &gnomever;?</b></p>
<!-- A9 -->
	    <p>The <tt>gnome2</tt> meta-port installs the 
	      metacity window manager by default.  Another popular window
	      manager that works well with GNOME &gnomever; is 
	      <a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/">sawfish</a>.  Sawfish
	      is distributed as part of the <tt>x11/gnome2-fifth-toe</tt>
	      meta-port.

	    <p>To switch between metacity and sawfish in GNOME 2, you will need
	      to do the following:</p>

<pre>
killall metacity; sawfish &
gnome-session-save --gui
</pre>
	    <p>The <tt>gnome-session-save</tt> is important.  Without it, the
	      window manager will revert back to the one previously configured
	      upon next login.  To switch back, simply reverse sawfish and 
	      metacity.</p>

		<p>If you have gotten the GNOME &gnomever; desktop working under an
		  alternative window manager, please take a screenshot and
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">send it to us</a>!
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q10 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q10"></a>
	    <p><b>Does GNOME &gnomever; support anti-aliased fonts?</b></p>
<!-- A10 -->
		<p>Yes!  Anti-aliasing requires XFree86 4.x with 
		  freetype2 support.  To add freetype2 support to X, make
		  sure you have the following modules loaded in your 
		  XF86Config file under the Modules section:</p>

		<pre>
Load	"freetype"
Load	"type1"
		</pre>
		
		<p>Then, simply check out the Fonts capplet under
		  Applications->Desktop Preferences.  If you want a good set
		  of TrueType starter fonts, install the 
		  <tt>x11-fonts/webfonts</tt> port.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, after adding new fonts to the system, it is
		  necessary to teach fontconfig about them.  If you find that
		  newly added fonts are not made available even after 
		  restarting GNOME 2, run the following command as root:</p>

		<pre>
# fc-cache -f -v
		</pre>

		<p>If you have any questions, please send them to 
		  <a href="mailto:&email;@FreeBSD.org">&email;@FreeBSD.org</a>.
		</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q11 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q11"></a>
	    <p><b>How can I control what fonts are anti-aliased?</b></p>
<!-- A11 -->
		<p>GNOME &gnomever; makes use of Xft and fontconfig to handle 
		  anti-aliasing.  Fontconfig is a very powerful XML-based
		  font configuration package.  You can create a
		  <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file that controls virtually
		  every aspect of fontconfig.  For example, if you do not
		  want to anti-alias fonts smaller than 16 point, create
		  a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> with the following contents:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

&lt;match target="font"&gt;
        &lt;test name="size" compare="less_eq"&gt;
                &lt;double&gt;16&lt;/double&gt;
        &lt;/test&gt;
        &lt;edit name="antialias" mode="assign"&gt;
                &lt;bool&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
        &lt;/edit&gt;
&lt;/match&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
                </pre>

                <p>Refer to fonts-conf(5) for more information.</p>

<!-- Q12 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q12"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I edit my GNOME 2 menus?</b></p>
<!-- A12 -->
	    <p>You need to use Nautilus to edit your GNOME 2 menus.  If you
	      want to edit any menu other than Favorites, you must be
	      root.</p>

	    <p>To edit the menus, launch Nautilus, and enter the URL 
	      <b>applications:///</b>.  From there you should be able to edit
	      your entire application menu.</p>
	  </li>

<!-- Q13 -->
	  <li style="padding-bottom: 0.5em"><a name="q13"></a>
	    <p><b>How do I use GTK+ 2 resource settings for GTK+ 2 applications
	      when not in a GNOME environment?</b></p>
<!-- A13 -->
	    <p> GNOME 2 applications get their GTK+ 2 resources from themes and
	      the corresponding theme engine.  If you would rather run your
	      GTK+ 2 applications in a non-GNOME environment then you will
	      need to create a file named <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>.</p>
		<p> To use the widgets from a GTK+ 2 theme when in a non-GNOME
		  environment, simply <tt>include</tt> the theme's
		  <tt>gtk-2.0/gtkrc</tt> in your <tt>~/.gtkrc-2.0</tt>. For example:

		  <pre>include "/usr/X11R6/share/themes/Crux/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"</pre>
		<p> If you prefer, you can use the same GTK+ 1.2 theme for both
		  GTK+ 1.2 and GTK+ 2 applications, which will give your GTK+
		  programs a consistent look. For the most part, you can transfer
		  your settings from your <tt>~/.gtkrc</tt> file (used for
		  GTK+ 1.2) with a couple of caveats.</p>

	      <ol>
	        <li> If you have any theme engine references, you will have
		  to make sure there is a corresponding GTK+ 2 theme engine.  
		  Otherwise, remove the engine entries.</li>
		<li> The default font specification should be outside of
		  any <tt>style</tt> blocks and should be specified with
		  the <tt>gtk-font-name</tt> keyword.  For example:

		  <pre>gtk-font-name = "Verdana 11"</pre>
		</li>
              </ol>

	        <p> Note that while a GTK+ 1.2 <tt>gtkrc</tt> file will work
		  in a GTK+ 2 <tt>gtkrc-2.0</tt> file, the opposite is <i>not</i>
		  true: the contents of a GTK+ 2 <tt>gtkrc-2.0</tt> file will
		  <i>not</i> work inside a GTK+ 1.2 <tt>gtkrc</tt> file.</p>

	      SCSI CAM subsystem.  Therefore, you must make sure
	      you have the following configured in your kernel:</p> 

	    <pre>
device          scbus
device          cd
device          pass
	    </pre>

	    <p>You must also make sure you have the following configured in
	      your kernel if you are using an ATAPI CD/DVD burner:</p>

	    <pre>
device		atapicam
	    </pre>

	    <p>To figure out which CD/DVD drive you will be using, run the
	      following command as root:</p>

	    <pre>
# camcontrol devlist
	    </pre>

	    <p>Your output will look similar to the following:</p>

	    <pre>
&lt;QSI CDRW/DVD SBW-242 UD22&gt;		at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (cd0,pass0)
	    </pre>

	    <p>The devices in parentheses at the end are important.  You
	      must make sure the <tt>/dev</tt> entries for those devices
	      are writable by the users that will be using 
	      nautilus-cd-burner.  In addition to those devices,
	      <tt>/dev/xpt*</tt> must also be writable to your 
	      nautilus-cd-burner users.  The following 
	      <tt>/etc/devfs.conf</tt> configuration will achieve the
	      desired results given the above devlist (<b>NB:</b> 
	      <tt>devfs.conf</tt> is only supported on FreeBSD 5.x):</p>

	      <pre>
perm    cd0     0666
perm    xpt0    0666
perm    pass0   0666
	      </pre>

	      <p>On FreeBSD 4.x, you can simply set the device node
	        permissions, and they will be preserved across reboots.
		Note that you must use the 'c' device nodes on
		FreeBSD 4.x (e.g. <tt>cd0c</tt>).</p>

	    <p><b>How do I add new GDM sessions?</b></p>
<!-- A16 -->
	  <p>The process for adding new GDM sessions has changed substantially
	    between GNOME 2.2 and &gnomever;.  In order to add new sessions
	    now, you must create a <tt>.desktop</tt> file containing the session
	    configuration information.  Session files live in
	    <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/dm/Sessions</tt>.  For example, to add
	    a KDE session, create a file in <tt>/usr/X11R6/etc/dm/Sessions</tt>
	    called <tt>kde.desktop</tt>.  That file should contain the
	    following:</p>

	    <pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=KDE
Comment=This session logs you into KDE
Exec=/usr/local/bin/startkde
TryExec=/usr/local/bin/startkde
Icon=
Type=Application
	    </pre>

	    <p>This file must have execute permissions.  For example:</p>

	    <pre>
# chmod 0555 kde.desktop
	    </pre>

	    <p>After creating this file, restart GDM, and there will be a
	      <b>KDE</b> link under the <em>Sessions</em> menu.</p>
	  </li>
