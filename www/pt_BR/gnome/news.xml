			with the help of the ``marcusmerge'' script.  For

			    Marcel Moolenaar</a>, the GNOME desktop now builds
			on ia64.  There are runtime issues to be resolved,

			in particular.  Not to mention that we can proceed
			porting and building other GNOME ports.  GNOME for
			FreeBSD now runs on i386, Alpha, Sparc64, and ia64.

		    <p>It's a bit late, but here none the less.  For those
			willing to live on the edge, the next installment
			of the GNOME 2.3 development snapshot, code named
			"Daddy Walrus," has been ported.  This snapshot
			lacks three ports found in the official GNOME
			distribution.  They are gnopernicus, gnome-speech,
			and gnome-system-tools.  The latter is missing
			because it does not fully work with FreeBSD, while
			the two former components rely on festival, which
			is broken on -CURRENT.  To help out with the

          <title>Full port of GNOME2 beta 5 release is available</title>

          <p>The FreeBSD <a href="mailto:gnome@FreeBSD.org">GNOME Team</a>
            has finished porting of GNOME2 beta 5 release to FreeBSD.
            All existing ports were updated and many missed were added.
            The FreeBSD Ports Collection now contains all bits and
            pieces of the GNOME2 platform, both desktop and development
            ones.</p>

          <p>The team now works on improving quility of the port, by
            tracking down FreeBSD-specific problems and fixing them.
            Another goal is to provide set of pre-built GNOME2 binary
            packages on the official FreeBSD 4.6 release media along with
            GNOME 1.4 bits and pieces.</p>
            
          <p>We would encourage any help from our users in the form of
            problem reports, patches, suggestions etc.</p>

          <p><a href="mailto:marcus@marcuscom.com">Joe Marcus Clarke</a> has
            been granted a FreeBSD commit bit (direct access to the cvs
            repository).  His main focus as a committer will be FreeBSD
            GNOME, so that expect much faster problem resolution than ever.
            It is also expected that he would revive somewhat stalled GNOME2
            porting effort.  Welcome aboard, Joe!!!</p>

          <p>The FreeBSD GNOME team started some initial work on getting
            GNOME2 bits and pieces running on FreeBSD.  The work is expected
            to take quite some time, though some initial set of ports
            making up core of the GNOME2 platform would be committed to the
            FreeBSD ports repository as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Famous <a href="mailto:ade@FreeBSD.org">Ade Lovett</a>, who was
            one of the main founders of the FreeBSD GNOME porting effort, but
            due to various reasons had left the FreeBSD GNOME team in June 2001
            decided to re-join us.  This is truly amazing news, because we
            still have many things to do, so that his help and huge
            experience in the field would be really useful.</p>
