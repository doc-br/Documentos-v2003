    <p>As the BSD projects (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD) have grown in size,
      a number of persistent myths have grown up around them. Some of these are
      perpetuated by well meaning but misguided individuals, others by people
      pursuing their own agendas.</p>

    <p>This page aims to dispel those myths while remaining as dispassionate
      as possible.</p>

    <blockquote><b>Note:</b> Throughout this page, ``*BSD'' refers to all
      three of the BSD Projects. Where a myth or response is specific to a
      particular project it is indicated as such.</blockquote>

    <h2>Myths</h2>

    <h3><a name="closed-model">*BSD</a> has a closed development
      model, it's more ``Cathedral'' than ``Bazaar''</h3>

    <p>Eric Raymond wrote an influential paper, ``<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The
      Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>'' in which the Linux development model
      (and the model Eric used for <tt>fetchmail</tt>) is held up as an
      example of how to do ``open'' development. By contrast, the model
      employed by *BSD is often characterized as closed.</p>

    <p>The implicit value judgment is that ``bazaar'' (open) is good, and
      ``cathedral'' (closed) is bad.</p>

    <p>If anything, *BSD's development model is probably
      <strong>more</strong> akin to the ``bazaar'' that Eric describes than
      either Linux or <tt>fetchmail</tt>.</p>

    <p>Consider the following;</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p><b>All the *BSD projects:</b> The current, bleeding edge source
          code for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD is available for anyone to download
          from the Internet, 24 hours a day. You don't need to wait for
          someone else to roll a release.</p>

	<p><b>FreeBSD, NetBSD:</b> An installable snapshot of the current
	  progress is made every 24 hours. These snapshots can be installed
	  exactly like an ordinary release, and do not require installation
	  over an existing system.</p>

	<p><b>OpenBSD:</b> Installable snapshots are generated as and when
	  people request on the OpenBSD mailing lists.</p>

	<p>Contrast this with Linux, where new kernel distributions are
	  made available on an ad-hoc basis, and where the frequency of
	  each Linux distribution release is at the whim of the individual
	  vendor.</p>

	<p>There's none of the Linux fanfare every time a new kernel is
	  released, simply because for most *BSD users it is an every day
	  event.</p></li>

        <li><p>All the *BSD Projects use CVS to maintain their source code.</p>

	<p><b>All the *BSD Projects:</b> make a CVS tree available for anyone to
	  browse and download, 24 hours a day. The tree can be retrieved using
	  Anonymous CVS, CVSup, CVSupit, CTM (by e-mail), or through simple
	  FTP.</p></li>

        <li><p>Anyone can submit patches, bug reports, documentation, and
	  other contributions. They can do this by using the <tt>send-pr</tt>
	  program installed on their *BSD system, or by using a web based
	  interface.</p>

	<p>Pointers to this system litter the documentation.</p></li>

        <li><p>Not everyone can commit code changes to the *BSD code. You
	  need to be a <EM>committer</EM> first. Typically, people are offered
	  ``commit privs'' after they have made a few well-thought out
	  submissions to the project using <tt>send-pr</tt> or similar.</p>

	<p>This is identical to the Linux mechanism. Only one person is
	  (notionally) allowed to change the Kernel, Linus. But specific areas
	  (such as the networking code) are delegated to other people.</p>

	<p><i>Aside: Nik (nik@FreeBSD.ORG) is a case in point. After making
	    several submissions to the FreeBSD Documentation Project and
	    web pages, he was offered ``commit privs'' so that he did not
	    have to keep bothering other committers to commit the changes. He
	    never had to ask for them, they were freely given.</i></p></li>
</ul>

    <p>Also, see this article written by Jordan Hubbard in Performance
      Computing, titled <a href="http://www.performance-computing.com/features/9810of1.shtml">What is FreeBSD?</a></p>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="own-distro">You</a> cannot make your own distributions
      or derivative works of *BSD</h3>

    <p>You can. You just need to say in the documentation and source
      files where the code is derived from.</p>

    <p>For example, PicoBSD is a tailored distribution of FreeBSD that
      fits on a floppy. It's great for turning a diskless 386 PC into a
      router or a network print server.</p>

    <p>The Whistle Interjet is a ``network appliance'' that acts as a
      router, web server, mailhost (and other functionality), and can be
      configured using a web browser. The underlying operating system is
      FreeBSD, and Whistle have contributed many of their code
      enhancements back to the FreeBSD project (while keeping enough of
      them proprietary that they can stay in business).</p>

    <p>The OpenBSD project started as a spinoff from the NetBSD project, and
      has since evolved its own distinctive approach.</p>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="server">*BSD</a> makes a great server, but a poor
      (&unix;) desktop</h3>

    <p>*BSD makes a great server. It also makes a great desktop. Many of
      the requirements for a server (responsiveness under load, stability,
      effective use of system resources) are the same requirements as for a
      desktop machine.</p>

    <p>*BSD has access to the same desktop tools (KDE, GNOME,
      windowmanagers) as Linux. And ``office'' applications such as
      WordPerfect or StarOffice work under BSD's Linux emulation
      layer.</p>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="old-codebase">The</a> BSD codebase is old, outdated, and
      dying</h3>

    <p>While the BSD codebase may be more than 20 years old, it is neither
      outdated or dying.  Many professional users like the stability that years
      of testing has provided FreeBSD.</p>

    <p>Technological enhancements continue to be added to *BSD, including,
      but not limited to;</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>SMP: Symmetric Multi-Processing, making use of systems with
	  multiple CPUs.</p></li>

        <li><p>SoftUpdates: Makes the BSD filesystem at least as fast as the
	  Linux filesystem, <strong>without</strong> needing to enable
	  asynchronous writes, with their associated risk.</p></li>

        <li><p>VM system: The VM (Virtual Memory) subsystem continues to be
	  refined. The merged VM/cache design helps systems like
	  wcarchive.cdrom.com juggle thousands (literally, more than 10,000)
	  simultaneous FTP connections without falling over.</p></li>

        <li><p>Architecture ports: Ports of *BSD are under way or already exist
	  on many other architectures, including UltraSPARC, Alpha, and PowerPC.
	  NetBSD and OpenBSD both have more architecture ports than FreeBSD, which
	  is, at the time of writing, running on i386, Alpha and
	  UltraSPARC.</p></li>
</ul>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="bsd-war">The</a> *BSD projects are at war with one another,
      splinter groups form each week</h3>

    <p>No. While occasional advocacy may get a touch heated, the *BSD flavors
      continue to work with one another. FreeBSD's Alpha port was initially
      heavily based on the work done by the NetBSD team. Both NetBSD and
      OpenBSD used the FreeBSD ports collection to bootstrap their own port
      sets. FreeBSD and NetBSD both integrate security fixes first discovered
      by the OpenBSD team.</p>

    <p>This cooperation extends to the commercial company BSDi, who graciously
      donated their DOS emulation layer to FreeBSD.</p>

    <p>The FreeBSD and NetBSD projects separated more than five years
      ago. OpenBSD is the only new BSD project to split off in the last five
      years.</p>

    <p>The *BSD projects cooperate in other areas as well. For example, the
      monthly publication <a href="http://www.daemonnews.org/">DaemonNews</a>
      is a collaborative effort by members of all three projects.</p>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="clustering">You</a> can't cluster *BSD systems (parallel
      computing)</h3>

    <p>The following URLs should disprove this;</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/">http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/</a>
          The Parallel Virtual Machine is nothing more than a software package that makes
          setting up a Cluster simple.  The source code is freely available, and will run
          on FreeBSD without much problem.</li>

    <h3><a name="support">There's no commercial support for *BSD</a></h3>

    <p><b>FreeBSD:</b> The <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/commercial/consulting.html">FreeBSD
	Commercial Consulting Page</a> lists companies that offer commercial
        support for FreeBSD.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.freebsdmall.com">FreeBSD
	  Mall</a> also offer commercial support, along with shirts,
	  hats, books, software, and promotional items.</p>

        <p>For training, one might try <a href="http://www.bsdmall.com/">BSDMall.com</a>, but they sell
          other items too, like shirts, hats, books and software!  Definitely worth a look.</p>

    <p><b>OpenBSD:</b> The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/support.html">OpenBSD Commercial
	Consulting Page</a> lists companies that offer commercial support for
        OpenBSD.</p>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="applications">There</a> are no applications for *BSD</h3>

    <p>The free software community started running on predominantly BSD
      systems(SunOS and similar). *BSD users can generally compile software
      written for these systems without needing to make any changes.</p>

    <p>In addition, each *BSD project uses a ``ports'' system to make the
      building of ported software much easier.</p>

    <p><b>FreeBSD:</b> There are currently more than 8,000
      applications ready to download and install in the FreeBSD ports
      collection. On both the i386 and Alpha, the Linux emulation layer will
      also run the vast majority of Linux applications.</p>

    <p><b>NetBSD:</b> The Linux emulation layer will run the vast majority of
      i386 Linux applications, and the majority of SunOS4 applications can be
      run on a SPARCStation.</p>

    <p><b>OpenBSD:</b> There are currently slightly more than 400 applications
      ready to download and install in the OpenBSD ports collection. The Linux
      emulation layer will also run the vast majority of i386 Linux
      applications, and the majority of SunOS4 applications can be run on a
      SPARCStation.</p>

    <p>Both NetBSD and OpenBSD are able to use applications in FreeBSD's ports
      collection with minimal effort. Their lower number of ported
      applications reflects this.</p>

    <p>It is true that most companies when porting to PC Unix will choose Linux
      first. Fortunately, *BSD's Linux emulation layer will run these
      programs (Acrobat, StarOffice, Mathematica, WordPerfect, Quake, Intel
      ICC compiler, Compaq's Alpha compiler ...)
      with few, if any, problems.</p>

    <p>As a historical note, the first version of Netscape Navigator that ran
      on FreeBSD with Java support was the Linux version. Now you can
      also use a native FreeBSD version of Mozilla with a native Java
      plugin, all compiled conveniently from the ports!</p>

    <hr noshade size="1">

    <h3><a name="aout">*BSD</a> uses the a.out executable format, which is
      outdated technology</h3>

        <p><b>FreeBSD:</b> Quite a while ago (before 1998) FreeBSD used the a.out
          format by default. There were no pressing reasons to switch earlier. In
          particular, FreeBSD did not (and does not) have the problems building
          shared libraries that spurred the Linux conversion from a.out to ELF. As
          of FreeBSD version 3.0, FreeBSD uses the ELF executable format.</p>

        <p>Check out the wonderful article that Tom Rhodes wrote about upgrading
          an a.out to ELF system, it has information on the way FreeBSD uses a.out and
          ELF, along with tons of other useful information.  The html version can be found here:
          <a href="http://www.Pittgoth.com/~darklogik/aout/article.html">
          http://www.Pittgoth.com/~darklogik/aout/article.html</a>, but its also available in
          the PDF (article.pdf), dvi (article.dvi), postscript (article.ps), sgml (article.sgml),
          and TeX (article.tex) versions.  Just change the extension as appropriate.</p>
