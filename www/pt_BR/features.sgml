    <h1>FreeBSD offers many advanced features.</h1>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>No matter what the application, you want your system's resources
	performing at their full potential.  FreeBSD's advanced features
	enable you to do just that.</p>

	4.4BSD.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FreeBSD's distinguished roots derive from the latest <b>BSD</b>
	software releases from the Computer Systems Research Group at the
	University of California, Berkeley.  The book <i>The Design and
	  Implementation of 4.4BSD Operating System</i>, written by the 4.4BSD
	system architects, thus describes much of FreeBSD's core functionality
	in detail.</p>

      <p>Drawing on the skills and experience of a diverse and world-wide
	group of volunteer developers, the FreeBSD Project has worked to
	extend the feature set of the 4.4BSD operating system in many ways,
	striving constantly to make each new release of the OS more stable,
	faster and containing new functionality driven by user requests.</p>

	greater compatibility with other operating systems and less system
	administration.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>FreeBSD's developers attacked some of the more difficult problems in
	operating systems design to give you these advanced features:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li><b>A merged virtual memory and filesystem buffer cache</b>
	  continuously tunes the amount of memory used for programs and the
	  disk cache.  As a result, programs receive both excellent memory
	    management and high performance disk access, and the system
	    administrator is freed from the task of tuning cache sizes.</li>
	
	<li><b>Compatibility modules</b> enable programs for other operating
	  systems to run on FreeBSD, including programs for Linux, SCO UNIX,
	  NetBSD, and BSD/OS.</li>
	  
	<li><b>Kernel Queues</b> allow programs to respond more efficiently
	  to a variety of asynchronous events including file and socket IO,
	  improving application and system performance.</li>

	<li><b>Accept Filters</b> allow connection-intensive applications,
	  such as web servers, to cleanly push part of their functionality into
	  the operating system kernel, improving performance.</li>

	<li><b>Soft Updates</b> allows improved filesystem
	  performance without sacrificing safety and reliability.
	  It analyzes meta-data filesystem operations to avoid having
	  to perform all of those operations synchronously.
	  Instead, it maintains internal state about pending meta-data
	  operations and uses this information to cache meta-data,
	  rewrite meta-data operations to combine subsequent
	  operations on the same files, and reorder meta-data
	  operations so that they may be processed more efficiently.</li>

	<li><b>Support for IPsec and IPv6</b> allows improved security in
	  networks, and support for the next-generation Internet Protocol,
	  IPv6.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Work in-progress includes support for fine-grained SMP locking in
        kernel, allowing higher performance on multi-processor machines,
        support for Scheduler Activations, allowing parallelism in threaded
        programs, filesystem snapshots, fsck-free booting, network
	optimizations such as zero-copy sockets and event-driven socket IO,		ACPI support, and advanced security features such as Mandatory
	Access Control.</p>
