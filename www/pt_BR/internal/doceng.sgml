<p>The doceng@ team is a new body to handle some of the meta-project
  issues associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  The main
  responsibilities of this team are :</p>

<ul>
  <li>To grant approval for new doc/, www/, release documentation, and
      manual page committers.</li>

  <li>To maintain the doc project primer, which documents best
      practices for the FreeBSD Documentation Project.</li>

  <li>To manage the doc/ release process.  This includes coordinating
      the release documentation updates with the various translation
      teams, coordinating with the release engineering team to tag the
      doc/ tree during the release cycle, and documenting these
      procedures.</li>

  <li>To ensure that the generated documentation (PDF, HTML, etc.) on
      the Web site and FTP site are up to date with respect to the
      versions of the documents in the CVS tree.  This includes making
      sure the Web site build is functioning correctly, and also
      involves working with the admin team to ensure that the primary
      Web server has all of the requisite software installed
      (including build scripts).</li>

  <li>To act as MAINTAINER (when necessary) or to work in coordination
      with existing MAINTAINERs, to ensure that the documentation
      toolchains (DocBook, groff, etc.) are in good working order.</li>

  <li>To maintain the sanctity of the FreeBSD doc/ and www/ trees.
      Due to the visibility of these files and documents to the
      outside world, doceng@ reserves the right to immediately backout
      (or fix without waiting for response from the original
      committer) changes that introduce broken links, cause the Web
      site build to break, or otherwise degrade the accessibility of
      the FreeBSD Web site and documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is specifically noted here that doceng@ is *not* a conflict
resolution body for the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  Discussion and
consensus on the freebsd-doc mailing list is how the project has
conducted itself, and how it is expected to conduct itself in the
future.</p>

<h2>Current Membership</h2>

The current members of this team are Nik Clayton, Ruslan Ermilov, Jun
Kuriyama, Bruce A. Mah, and Murray Stokely.  It is expected that the
membership of this list will increase as additional members from the
various translation teams are added.

<h2>New Doc Committers</h2>

New doc committers are approved by doceng@ with a vote through email
and a 1 week timeout.  A committer is approved if at least 1 doceng@
member votes yes, and no doceng@ members vote no.

core@ is CCed on the message to admins@ about the new account.
