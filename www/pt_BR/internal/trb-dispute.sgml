    <h2>TRB Dispute Resolution:</h2>

    <p>This document outlines the procedure that the Technical Review Board (TRB)
      follows when resolving disagreements of a technical nature.  This document
      does not describe the whole of the TRB responsibilities and procedures.
      If at any time during the resolution of the conflict the two parties come
      to a mutual agreement the TRB arbitration process will end.</p>

    <p>A technical dispute is brought to the TRB.  This may happen at the
      request of a participant in a deadlocked dispute.  It may also happen
      if it becomes clear to a member of the TRB or core that the disputing
      parties are not able to resolve the issue in a timely or professional
      manner.</p>

    <p>The TRB will announce on arch@ that it is considering an issue.  A
      request is made for all interested parties to submit one email
      stating their position on this issue to the trb@ mailing list.  These
      emails are available to all committers via the trb archive.</p>

    <p>The TRB makes requests of those who have submitted their opinions on
      the subject to clarify points.  This discussion will continue on the
      trb@ list.  If possible the TRB will steer the involved parties
      towards resolving the issue themselves.</p>

    <p>A member of the TRB produces a brief document describing the core
      technical issues and a summary of the opinions of either side.  If
      the involved parties can not come to a conclusion themselves the
      TRB will decide on a best plan of action based on the facts
      presented.</p>

    <p>A vote is held on trb-private@.  This is done privately to mitigate
      any impressions of bias either way from individual members of TRB.
      If a member of TRB has some non technical interest in the vote they
      are required to abstain from voting.</p>

    <p>The results of the private vote are announced on arch@ and trb@.
      This will include a short statement detailing the position of the
      TRB on this issue and the number of votes for each option.  The
      decision will be based on a majority vote.  The results are
      considered final and all appeals must go through core@.</p>
