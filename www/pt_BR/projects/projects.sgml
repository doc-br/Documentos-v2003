<li><a name="tcfs" href="http://www.tcfs.it/">TCFS</a>
is a Transparent Cryptographic File System that is a suitable
solution to the problem of privacy for distributed filesystem. By a
deeper integration between the encryption service and the filesystem,
it results in a complete transparency of use to the user
applications. Files are stored in encrypted form and are decrypted
before they are read. The encryption/decryption process takes place on
the client machine and thus the encryption/decryption key never
travels on the network.</li>

<li><a name="Tertiary" href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/Td/">Tertiary Disk</a>
is a storage system architecture to create large disk storage systems
that avoid the disadvantages of custom built disk arrays. The
name comes from twin goals: to have the cost per megabyte and
capacity of tape libraries and the performance of magnetic
disks. We use commodity, off the shelf components to develop a
scalable, low cost, terabyte capacity disk system. Our target is
to build a complete storage system with about 30-50% extra to
the cost of the raw disk.  Tertiary Disk uses PCs connected by a
switched network to host a large number of disks. Our prototype
consists of 20 200MHz PC PCs, which host 370 8GB disks. The PCs
are connected through a 100Mbps Ethernet switch.</li>

<li><a name="vinum" href="http://www.vinumvm.org/">Vinum</a>

enforce write-ahead logging and guarantee consistency.

<li><a name="atm" href="http://www.ccrc.wustl.edu/pub/chuck/tech/bsdatm/bsdatm.html"> BSD ATM: implementation of ATM internetworking under 4.4BSD</a>:
New computer applications in areas such as multimedia, imaging,
and distributed computing demand high levels of performance from
computer networks. ATM-based networking solutions provide one
possible alternative to meeting these performance needs.
However, the complexity of ATM over traditional networks such as
Ethernet has proven to be a barrier to its being used. In this
paper we present the design and implementation of BSD ATM, a
light-weight and efficient ATM software layer for BSD-based
operating systems that requires minimal changes to the operating
system. BSD ATM can be used both for IP-based networking traffic
and for ``native'' ATM traffic.</li>

<li><a name="oskit" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">The OSKit</a>
The OSKit is a framework and a set of 31 component libraries oriented
to operating systems, together with extensive documentation. By
providing in a modular way not only most of the infrastructure
"grunge" needed by an OS, but also many higher-level components, the
OSKit's goal is to lower the barrier to entry to OS R&amp;D and to
lower its costs. The OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new OS,
port an existing OS to the x86 (or in the future, to other
architectures supported by the OSkit), or enhance an OS to support a
wider range of devices, filesystem formats, executable formats, or
network services. The OSKit also works well for constructing OS-related

microkernel.</li>
