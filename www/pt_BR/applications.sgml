    <h1>Experimente as possibilidades com o FreeBSD</h1>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
      O FreeBSD pode lidar com praticamente todas as tarefas que voc&ecirc;
      espera de uma esta&ccedil;&atilde;o de trabalho &unix;, assim como muitas as
      quais voc&ecirc; nem espera que ele fa&ccedil;a:</p>

	source code.</font></font>
    

    <blockquote>
      <p>There is no doubt that so-called open systems are <i>the</i>
	requirement for today's computing applications.  But no commercial
	vendor-supplied solution is more open than one which includes full
	source code to the entire operating system, including the kernel and
	all of the system daemons, programs, and utilities.  You can modify
	any part of FreeBSD to suit your personal, organizational, or
	corporate needs.</p>

      <p>With its generous <a
	  href="&base;/copyright/freebsd-license.html">licensing policy</a>,
	you can use FreeBSD as the basis for any number of free <i>or
	  commercial </i>applications.</p>

    <hr align="left" noshade="noshade" width="100%"><font
      color="#FF0000"><font size="+1">FreeBSD&nbsp;runs thousands of
	applications.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Because FreeBSD is based on 4.4BSD, an industry-standard version of
	UNIX, it is easy to compile and run programs.  FreeBSD also includes
	an extensive <a href="&base;/where.html">packages collection </a>and <a
	  href="&base;/ports/index.html">ports collection</a> that bring
	precompiled and easy-to-build software right to your desktop or
	enterprise server.  There is also a growing number of <a
	  href="&base;/commercial/commercial.html">commercial applications</a>
	written for FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>Here are some examples of the environments in which FreeBSD is
	used:</p>
      
      <ul>
	<li><b>Internet services. </b>Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
	  find FreeBSD ideal, running WWW, Usenet news, FTP, Email, and other
	  services.  Ready-to-run software like the <a
	    href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> web server or the Wu-ftpd
	  FTP&nbsp;server make it easy to set up a business or
	  community-centered ISP.  Of course, with FreeBSD's unbeatable <a
	    href="&base;/internet.html">networking</a>, your users will enjoy
	  high speed, reliable services.</li>

	<li><b>X Window workstation. </b>From an inexpensive X terminal to an
	  advanced X display, FreeBSD works quite well.  Free X software (<a
	    href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a>&trade;) comes with the
	  system. <a href="http://www.xig.com/">Xi Graphics</a> offers
	  accelerated X software for high-performance graphics hardware (such
	  as Matrox), as well as the industry standard Motif&reg; and OpenGL&reg;
	  libraries.</li>
	
	<li><b>Networking. </b>From packet filtering to routing to name
	  service, FreeBSD can turn any PC into a Internet firewall, email
	  host, print server, PC/NFS server, and more.</li>

	<li><b>Software development.</b> A suite of development tools comes
	  with FreeBSD, including the GNU C/C++ compiler and debugger and the
	  Perl scripting language.  &java; and Tcl/Tk development are also
	  possible.  Popular editors like XEmacs and more esoteric programming
	  languages like Icon work just fine, too.  And FreeBSD's shared
	  libraries have always been easy to make and use.</li>

	<li><b>Net surfing.</b> A real UNIX workstation makes a great Internet 
	  surfboard, and the BSD version of <a
	    href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/communicator/index.html">Netscape
	    Navigator</a> with Java support runs on FreeBSD. Surf the web,
	  publish your own web pages, read Usenet news, and send and receive
	  email with a FreeBSD system on your desktop.</li>

	<li><b>Education and research.</b> &nbsp;FreeBSD makes an excellent
	  research platform because it includes complete source code.
	  Students and researchers of operating systems or other computer
	  science fields can benefit greatly from such an open and
	  well-documented system.</li>

	<li><b>And much more. </b>Accounting, action games,
	  MIS&nbsp;databases, scientific visualization, video conferencing,
	  Internet relay chat (IRC), home automation, multiuser dungeons,
	  bulletin board systems, image scanning, and more are all real uses
	  for FreeBSD today.  If you have an innovative application for
	  FreeBSD, <a href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/gallery.cgi">let us
	    know</a> so we can add it to our <a

	your needs.</font></font>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Though FreeBSD is free software, it is also <i>user supported
	</i>software.  Any questions you have can be posted to hundreds of
	FreeBSD developers and users simply by e-mailing the <a
	  href="mailto:freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.ORG">freebsd-questions@FreeBSD.ORG</a>
	mailing list.</p>
      
      <p>FreeBSD also has a worldwide group of programmers and writers who fix 
	bugs, add new features and document the system.  Support for new
	devices or special features is an almost constant development process,
	and the team keeps a special eye out for problems which affect system
	stability.  FreeBSD users are quite proud of not only how fast but how
	reliable their systems are.</p>
