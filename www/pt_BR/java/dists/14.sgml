<b>November 11, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the fifth patchset (patchlevel 5) for the &jdk; 1.4
software.  This release updates the &jdk; to version 1.4.2.  Thanks to
a lot of hard work by <a href="mailto:phantom@FreeBSD.org">Alexey Zelkin</a>
this release passes Sun's compatibility tests in all but a mixed IPv4 and
IPv6 environment.  Information on downloading the patchset can be found at

<b>October 10, 2003:</b> <a href="mailto:glewis@FreeBSD.org">Greg
Lewis</a> has released the fourth patchset (patchlevel 4) for the &jdk; 1.4
software.  The code is now suitable for most applications, although it does
still contain some problems.  Browser plugin support works, GCC 3.3 is
supported and many bugfixes are included.  This patchset is the 
result of a lot of hard work by the BSD Java Porting Team and continued
support from the FreeBSD Foundation.  Information on downloading the patchset
can be found at
