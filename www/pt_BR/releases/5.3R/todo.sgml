<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SCHED_ULE as the default scheduler</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.jeff;</td>
    <td>SCHED_ULE provides better interactivity, higher performance, and the
      ability to support pinning and affinity.  Basic HTT scheduling policies
      should be in place for 5.3 also.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>KSE as the default threads library</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.davidxu;, &a.deischen;</td>
    <td>KSE has matured to the point of being more stable and POSIX-compliant
      than the traditional libc_r.  All Tier-1 platforms <b>MUST</b> have
      stable KSE support for 5.3 in order to support a consistent transition.
      Additionally, all ports that depend on the pthreads API must be modified
      to properly detect and support the default threading library.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Updated binutils for all platforms</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.obrien;</td>
    <td>Binutils needs updating in order to support new platforms, newer GDB
      versions, and Thread Local Storage.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>BIND9 import into 5-CURRENT</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.dougb;</td>
    <td>BIND9 must be imported for 5.3-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Completed compiler support for dynamic </td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>&a.obrien;</td>
    <td>All platforms but IA64 have modifications to support /libexec/ld.so
      in the gcc base source tree; these changes must be merged back into
      the FSF tree and brought into FreeBSD on the vendor branch for
      5.3-RELEASE.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>GDB thread support</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>Glenn Gombert</td>
    <td>With improved support for threading primitives, support is now
      required to ease debugging of threaded applications.  Ideally,
      this support will work for both libthr and libkse threading
      models.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>busdma in all PCI drivers</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>All PCI drivers must use busdma for DMA; no use of vtophys() will
      be permitted for any recent device driver.  ISA drivers may be 
      exempt.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>truss support for ptrace</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.robert;</td>
    <td>Almost all process debugging tools have been updated to use
      non-procfs kernel primitives, with the exception of truss(1).
      As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherent security
      risks, it is highly desirable to update truss to operate in
      a post-procfs world.  &a.des; had prototype patches; &a.robert;
      is developing and testing patches now.  Support for system
      call tracing has been added to ptrace().</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Fine-grained network stack locking without Giant</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.sam;</td>
    <td>Significant parts of the network stack (especially IPv4 and
      IPv6) now have fine-grained locking of their data structures.
      By 5.3-RELEASE, it is necessary to have the vast majority of
      network code running without Giant, including sockets, permitting
      complete local<->remote delivery without grabbing Giant.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>make -DUSE_KQUEUE causes lockup with buildworld -jBIGNUM</td>
    <td>&status.untested;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Attempts to use make(1) with KQueues appears to result in a kernel
      hang under "heavy load".  It would be desirable to fix this
      both from the perspective of building FreeBSD quickly as a
      developer, but also because it's an instability that could show
      up under other high load and heavy use of KQueues.  See PR
      kern/57945 for a proposed patch and details.  This appear to be
      the product of a locking problem, and must be fixed for 5.3.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>LINT build on amd64</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.obrien;, &a.peter;</td>

<h3>Desired features for 5.3-RELEASE</h3>

<table border=1 width="100%">
  <tr><th>Issue</th><th>Status</th><th>Responsible</th><th>Description</th>
      </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Per object ELF Prebinding support</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.mdodd;</td>
    <td><p>Prebinding reduces executable startup time by lowering the
      expense of symbol lookup, binding and relocation.  This is  
      accomplished by a prebinding data file or ELF segment that  
      contains intermediate lookup results allowing fast symbol binding
      and relocation, provided that dependent objects remain unchanged
      since the prebinding information was generated.</p>

    <p>The benefits of prebinding are realized when running executables
      that use a large (>10) number of shared libraries.  C++
      applications also benefit as they contain a large number of
      relocations.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Per-platform Thread-Local Storage</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>To complete support for thread-local storage on FreeBSD,
      per-architecture changes must be made.  Currently pending
      platforms are amd64, alpha, ia64, i386, sparc64, and powerpc.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC and KAME compatibility</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>FAST_IPSEC currently cannot be used directly with the KAME IPv6
      implementation, requiring an additional level of IP tunnel
      indirection to protect IPv6 packets when using hardware crypto
      acceleration.  This issue must be resolved so that the two
      services may more easily be used together.  Among other things,
      this will require a careful review of the handling of mbuf
      header copying and m_tag support in the KAME IPv6 code.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>rpc.lockd(8) stability</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>A process cannot be interrupted while waiting on a lock.  Fixing
      this requires that the RPC code be taught how to deal with lock
      cancellation and interruption events.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Revised kld build infrastructure</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&.peter;</td>
    <td>Kernel modules are currently built independently from a kernel
      configuration, and independently from one another, resulting in
      substantially redundant compilation of objects, as well as the
      inability to easily manage compile-time options for kernel
      objects (such as MAC, PAE, etc) that may require conditional
      compilation in the kernel modules.  In order to improve build
      performance and better support options of this sort, the
      KLD build infrastructure needs to be revamped.  &a.peter; has
      done some initial prototyping, and should be contacted before
      starting on this work.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Merge of Darwin msdosfs, other fixes</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>Apple's Darwin operating system has fairly extensive improvements
      to msdosfs and other kernel services; these fixes must be reviewed
      and merged to the FreeBSD tree.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>Race conditions in truss</td>
  <td>Errata candidate</td>
  <td>&a.robert;</td>
  <td>Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of
    debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process
    before it exits.  The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot
    open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged.  A bug
    also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns
    ENOENT.  A further race appears to exist in which truss will return
    "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup.  The fix
    for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we
    will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>ACL_MASK override of umask support in UFS</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Many systems supporting POSIX.1e ACLs permit a minor violation
      to that specification, in which the ACL_MASK entry overrides the
      umask, rather than being intersected with it.  The resulting
      semantics can be useful in group-oriented environments, and as
      such would be very helpful on FreeBSD.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>filedesc LOR</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>The LOR reported in PR kern/55175 needs to be fixed.  Filedesc locking
      needs to be heavily reviewed in general.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>MAC Framework devfs path fixes</td>
    <td>&status.wip;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>&a.green; has submitted patches to improve the consistency
      of the pathnames passed into the MAC Framework devfs labeling
      entry points.  These patches need to be thoroughly reviewed
      and tested, then merged.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>MAC support for NFS Server</td>
    <td>&status.new;</td>
    <td>&a.rwatson;</td>
    <td>Currently, MAC protections are enforced only on locally originated
      file system operations (VOPs), and not on RPCs generated via the
      NFS server.  Improvements in NFS server credential handling are
      required to correct this problem, as well as the introduction of
      new entry points to properly label NFS credentials and perform
      enforcement properly.</td>
