<h2>What are snapshots?</h2>


    <p>As part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall
      release process <em>before</em> a release actually slips
      out the door with problems that make folks mad, we are now
      periodically producing interim <em>test</em> releases
      called snapshots.  These snapshots will be very similar to
      full releases, except that they will be somewhat more
      minimal.  In particular, before getting and installing a
      snapshot release, be aware of following:

    <ul>

	<li>We generally will not, for example, produce new
	XFree86 distributions or worry much about the tools
	directory, unless either of those two things are affected
	by the changes being tested.

      <li>The major release number will not be changed in the
	main distribution for each snapshot.  It will
	<em>only</em> be changed on the boot floppies so that you
	know when the snapshot was made.  These are <em>not</em>
	releases, these are <em>snapshots</em>, and it is
	important that this distinction be preserved.  People can
	and will, of course, refer to snapshots by date in mail
	or netnews, we just do not want them to start thinking
	that Christmas came early and the next release is already
	out!

      <li>Finally, we will not necessarily update the
	documentation.  If a README still refers to a previous release,
        well, that is much less important to than getting the
	real bug fixes and new features out for testing.  Complaints
	about that kind of thing will be quietly ignored.  Again,
	these are <em>snapshots</em>, not releases!
    </ul>

    <p>Your feedback on these snapshots is, of course, greatly
      welcome.  They are not just for our benefit - those who are
      coming to rely on FreeBSD for mission critical
      applications should welcome a chance to get at more updated
      bits in a structured fashion.  You can also use these
      snapshots as tangible evidence that your feedback is
      getting incorporated and that you (hopefully) will not have
      any unpleasant surprises in the next release.  On the other hand, if
      you do send us hate mail next release and it turns out that you
      never even tried the snapshots, well, it cuts both ways!

    <h2>Where to find snapshots</h2>

    <p>Snapshots of <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html#CURRENT">FreeBSD-CURRENT</a>
        are available via anonymous FTP from
        <a href="ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/">
        ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/</a>.
	The snapshot releases are in directories named in the
	format <b>REL-YYMMDD-SNAP</b> where `<b>REL</b>' is the
	release number, `<b>YY</b>' is the year, `<b>MM</b>' is
	the month, and `<b>DD</b>' is the day the snapshot was
	released.  Each snapshot directory contains a
	`<b>README</b>' file which outlines the changes for the
	particular snapshot.</p>

    <p>By popular demand, snapshots are also now available for the
        <a href="&base;/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html#STABLE">FreeBSD-STABLE</a> branch via anonymous FTP from
	<a href="ftp://releng4.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/">
	ftp://releng4.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/</a>.
	The snapshot releases are in directories named in the
	same manner as -current snapshots, but ending in the keyword
	RELENG instead of SNAP.
