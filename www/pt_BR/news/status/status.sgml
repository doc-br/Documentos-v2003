  <p>One of the benefits of the FreeBSD development model is a focus on
    centralized design and implementation, in which the operating system is
    maintained in a central repository, and discussed on centrally maintained
    lists.  This allows for a high level of coordination between authors of
    various components of the system, and allows policies to be enforced over
    the entire system, covering issues ranging from architecture to style. 
    However, as the FreeBSD developer community has grown, and the rate of
    both mailing list traffic and tree modifications has increased, making it
    difficult even for the most dedicated developer to remain on top of all
    the work going on in the tree.</p>

  <p>The FreeBSD Bi-Monthly Development Status Report attempts to address this
    problem by providing a vehicle that allows developers to make the broader
    community aware of their on-going work on FreeBSD, both in and out of the
    central source repository.  For each project and sub-project, a one
    paragraph summary is included, indicating progress since the last summary.
    If it is a new project, or if a project has not submitted any prior status
    reports, a short description may precede the status information.</p>

  <p>These status reports may be reproduced in whole or in part, as long as the
    source is clearly identified and appropriate credit given. </p>
