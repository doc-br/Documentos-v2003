<!--  
  Base is the absolute URL for the given page, minus the actual page
  part.  It should either be specified as a fully qualified URL, or
  relative to the server root.  It should be defined in the prolog
  <em>before</em> including this file if the page does not live at the
  default location below. 

  When making a link, use <a href="&base;/mypage.html">foo</a> and
  &base; will be expanded appropriately.  Base is also used in the
  definition of standard boilerplate entities in this file, so be sure
  base is correct!

  To translators: When making a link to original documents are needed,
  use &enbase; instead of &base;.
