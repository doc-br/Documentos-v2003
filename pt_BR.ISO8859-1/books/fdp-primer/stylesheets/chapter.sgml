<chapter id="stylesheets">
  <title>* Folhas de Estilo</title>
    
  <para>O SGML n&atilde;o diz nada sobre como um original deve ser
    exibido ao usu&aacute;rio, ou ser formatado no papel.  Para fazer
    isto, v&aacute;rias l&iacute;nguagens foram desenvolvidas para
    descrever folhas de estilo, incluindo DynaText, Panorama, SPICE,
    JSSS, FOSI, CSS, e DSSSL.</para>

  <para>For DocBook, we are using stylesheets written in DSSSL.  For HTML we
    are using CSS.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>* DSSSL</title>
    
    <para>The Documentation Project uses a slightly customised version of
      Norm Walsh's modular DocBook stylesheets.</para>
    
    <para>These can be found in
      <filename role="package">textproc/dsssl-docbook-modular</filename>.</para>

    <para>The modified stylesheets are not in the ports system.  Instead they
      are part of the Documentation Project source repository, and can be
      found in <filename>doc/share/sgml/freebsd.dsl</filename>.  It is well
      commented, and pending completion of this section you are encouraged to
      examine that file to see how some of the available options in the
      standard stylesheets have been configured in order to customise the
      output for the FreeBSD Documentation Project.  That file also contains
      examples showing how to extend the elements that the stylesheet
      understands, which is how the FreeBSD specific elements have been
      formatted.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>CSS</title>

    <para>Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) are a mechanism for attaching style
      information (font, weight, size, color, and so forth) to elements in an
      HTML document without abusing HTML to do so.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>The Web site (HTML documents)</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD web site does not currently use CSS.  Unfortunately,
	the look and feel is constructed using abuses of HTML of varying
	degrees.  This should be fixed, and would be a good project for
	someone looking to contribute to the documentation project.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The DocBook documents</title>

      <para>The FreeBSD DSSSL stylesheets include a reference to a stylesheet,
	<filename>docbook.css</filename>, which is expected to appear in the
	same directory as the HTML files.  The project-wide CSS file is copied
	from <filename>doc/share/misc/docbook.css</filename> when documents
	are converted to HTML, and is installed automatically.</para>
