      <para>FreeBSD é baseado a versão 4.4BSD-Lite do Grupo de Pesquisa
	em Sistemas Computacionais (<acronym>CSRG</acronym>) da Universidade
	da Califórnia, Berkeley, e carrega consigo a distinta tradição do
	desenvolvimento de sistemas BSD. Em adição ao aprimorado trabalho
	realizado pelo <acronym>CSRG</acronym>, o projeto FreeBSD acrescentou
	ainda muitos milhares de horas no aperfeiçoamento do sistema para
	máxima performance e confiabilidade em situações de demanda da
	da vida real. Enquanto muitos dos gigantes comerciais se esforçam
	no campo dos sistemas operacionais para PC afim de oferecer tais
	funcionalidades com performance e cofiabilidade, o FreeBSD os
	oferece <emphasis>agora</emphasis>!</para>

      <para>As aplicações que podem ser atribuídas ao FreeBSD são
	realmente limitadas apenas à sua imaginação.  Do desenvolvimento
	de software à automação indústrial, controle de inventário à
	correção __azimuth__ remota de antenas de satélite; se pode ser feito
	com um produto &unix; comercial, é muito provável que possa ser feito
	com FreeBSD também!  FreeBSD também se beneficia de forma significante
	de literalmente milhares de aplicações de alta qualidade desenvolvidas
	por centros de pesquisa e universidades ao redor do mundo, usualmente
	disponíveis à baixo ou nenhum custo. Aplicações comerciais também
	estão disponíveis e surgindo em grandes números a cada dia.</para>

      <para>Because the source code for FreeBSD itself is generally
        available, the system can also be customized to an almost unheard
	of degree for special applications or projects, and in ways not

        <primary>FreeBSD Project</primary>
        <secondary>history</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The FreeBSD project had its genesis in the early part of 1993,
	partially as an outgrowth of the <quote>Unofficial 386BSD
        Patchkit</quote> by the patchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate
	Williams, Rod Grimes and myself.</para>
    
      <indexterm><primary>386BSD</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Our original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot of
	386BSD in order to fix a number of problems with it that the
	patchkit mechanism just was not capable of solving.  Some of you
	may remember the early working title for the project being
	<quote>386BSD 0.5</quote> or <quote>386BSD Interim</quote> in
	reference to that fact.</para>
    
      <indexterm><primary>Jolitz, Bill</primary></indexterm>
      <para>386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been up
	to that point suffering rather severely from almost a year's worth
	of neglect.  As the patchkit swelled ever more uncomfortably with
	each passing day, we were in unanimous agreement that something
	had to be done and decided to assist Bill by providing
	this interim <quote>cleanup</quote> snapshot.  Those plans came to
	a rude halt when Bill Jolitz suddenly decided to withdraw his
	sanction from the project without any clear indication of what
	would be done instead.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Greenman, David</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Walnut Creek CDROM</primary></indexterm>
      <para>It did not take us long to decide that the goal remained
	worthwhile, even without Bill's support, and so we adopted the
	name <quote>FreeBSD</quote>, coined by David Greenman.  Our initial
	objectives were set after consulting with the system's current
	users and, once it became clear that the project was on the road
	to perhaps even becoming a reality, I contacted Walnut Creek CDROM
	with an eye toward improving FreeBSD's distribution channels for
	those many unfortunates without easy access to the Internet.
	Walnut Creek CDROM not only supported the idea of distributing
	FreeBSD on CD but also went so far as to provide the project with a
	machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  Without Walnut
	Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in what was, at
	the time, a completely unknown project, it is quite unlikely that
        FreeBSD would have gotten as far, as fast, as it has today.</para>

      <para>The first CDROM (and general net-wide) distribution was
	FreeBSD&nbsp;1.0, released in December of 1993.  This was based on the
	4.3BSD-Lite (<quote>Net/2</quote>) tape from U.C. Berkeley, with
	many components also provided by 386BSD and the Free Software
	Foundation.  It was a fairly reasonable success for a first
	offering, and we followed it with the highly successful FreeBSD
	1.1 release in May of 1994.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>U.C. Berkeley</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Net/2</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>AT&amp;T</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed
	on the horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their
	long-running lawsuit over the legal status of the Berkeley Net/2
	tape.  A condition of that settlement was U.C. Berkeley's
	concession that large parts of Net/2 were <quote>encumbered</quote>
	code and the property of Novell, who had in turn acquired it from
	AT&amp;T some time previously.  What Berkeley got in return was
	Novell's <quote>blessing</quote> that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when
	it was finally released, would be declared unencumbered and all
	existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to switch.  This
	included FreeBSD, and the project was given until the end of July
	1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based product.  Under the
	terms of that agreement, the project was allowed one last release
	before the deadline, that release being FreeBSD&nbsp;1.1.5.1.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally
	re-inventing itself from a completely new and rather incomplete
	set of 4.4BSD-Lite bits.  The <quote>Lite</quote> releases were
	light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had removed large chunks of
	code required for actually constructing a bootable running system
	(due to various legal requirements) and the fact that the Intel
	port of 4.4 was highly incomplete.  It took the project until
	November of 1994 to make this transition, at which point it
	released FreeBSD&nbsp;2.0 to the net and on CDROM (in late December).
	Despite being still more than a little rough around the edges,
	the release was a significant success and was followed by the
	more robust and easier to install FreeBSD&nbsp;2.0.5 release in June of
	1995.</para>

      <para>We released FreeBSD&nbsp;2.1.5 in August of 1996, and it appeared
	to be popular enough among the ISP and commercial communities that
	another release along the 2.1-STABLE branch was merited.  This was
	FreeBSD&nbsp;2.1.7.1, released in February 1997 and capping the end of
	mainstream development on 2.1-STABLE.  Now in maintenance mode,
	only security enhancements and other critical bug fixes will be
	done on this branch (RELENG_2_1_0).</para>

      <para>FreeBSD&nbsp;2.2 was branched from the development mainline
	(<quote>-CURRENT</quote>) in November 1996 as the RELENG_2_2
	branch, and the first full release (2.2.1) was released in April
	1997.  Further releases along the 2.2 branch were done in the
	summer and fall of '97, the last of which (2.2.8) appeared in
	November 1998. The first official 3.0 release appeared in
	October 1998 and spelled the beginning of the end for the 2.2
	branch.</para>

      <para>The tree branched again on Jan 20, 1999, leading to the
	4.0-CURRENT and 3.X-STABLE branches.  From 3.X-STABLE, 3.1 was
	released on February 15, 1999, 3.2 on May 15, 1999, 3.3 on
	September 16, 1999, 3.4 on December 20, 1999, and 3.5 on
	June 24, 2000, which was followed a few days later by a minor
	point release update to 3.5.1, to incorporate some last-minute
	security fixes to Kerberos. This will be the final release in the
	3.X branch.</para>

      <para>There was another branch on March 13, 2000, which saw the
	emergence of the 4.X-STABLE branch, now considered to be the
	<quote>current -stable branch</quote>.  There have been several releases
	from it so far: 4.0-RELEASE was introduced in March 2000, and
	the most recent &rel2.current;-RELEASE came out in
	&rel2.current.date;.  There will be additional releases
	along the 4.X-stable (RELENG_4) branch well into 2003.</para>

      <para>The long-awaited 5.0-RELEASE was announced on January 19,
      2003.  The culmination of nearly three years of work, this
      release started FreeBSD on the path of advanced multiprocessor
      and application thread support and introduced support for the
      &ultrasparc; and <literal>ia64</literal> platforms.  This release was followed by 5.1 in
      June of 2003.  Besides a number of new features, the 5.X
      releases also contain a number of major developments in the
      underlying system architecture. Along with these advances,
      however, comes a system that incorporates a tremendous amount of
      new and not-widely-tested code. For this reason, the 5.X
      releases are considered <quote>New Technology</quote> releases, while the 4.X
      series function as <quote>Production</quote> releases.  In time, 5.X will be
      declared stable and work will commence on the next development
      branch, 6.0-CURRENT.</para>

      <para>For now, long-term development projects continue to take place in the
	5.X-CURRENT (trunk) branch, and SNAPshot releases of 5.X on
	CDROM (and, of course, on the net) are continually made available
	from <ulink url="ftp://current.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/">
	the snapshot server</ulink> as work progresses.</para>

      <para>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that
	may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.  Many of
	us have a significant investment in the code (and project) and
	would certainly not mind a little financial compensation now and
	then, but we are definitely not prepared to insist on it.  We
	believe that our first and foremost <quote>mission</quote> is to
	provide code to any and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so
	that the code gets the widest possible use and provides the widest
	possible benefit.  This is, I believe, one of the most fundamental
	goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically
	support.</para>

        opposite.  Due to the additional complexities that can evolve
        in the commercial use of GPL software we do, however, prefer
        software submitted under the more relaxed BSD copyright when
        it is a reasonable option to do so.</para>

	    <para>The <firstterm>FreeBSD core team</firstterm>
	      would be equivalent to the board of directors if the FreeBSD
	      Project were a company.  The primary task of the core team

	      and is heading in the right directions.  Inviting dedicated
	      and responsible developers to join our group of committers
	      is one of the functions of the core team, as is the
	      recruitment of new core team members as others move on.
	      The current core team was elected from a pool of committer

      <para>FreeBSD is a freely available, full source 4.4BSD-Lite based
        release for Intel &i386;, &i486;, &pentium;,
        &pentium;&nbsp;Pro,
        &celeron;,

        &xeon;, DEC <trademark>Alpha</trademark>
        and Sun &ultrasparc; based computer
        systems.  It is based primarily on software from U.C. Berkeley's
        CSRG group, with some enhancements from NetBSD, OpenBSD, 386BSD, and
        the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <para>Since our release of FreeBSD&nbsp;2.0 in late 94, the performance,
        feature set, and stability of FreeBSD has improved dramatically.
	<!-- XXX is the rest of this paragraph still true ? -->
        The largest change is a revamped virtual memory system with a merged
        VM/file buffer cache that not only increases performance, but also
        reduces FreeBSD's memory footprint, making a 5&nbsp;MB configuration a
        more acceptable minimum.  Other enhancements include full NIS client
        and server support, transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP,
        integrated DHCP support, an improved SCSI subsystem, ISDN support,
        support for ATM, FDDI, Fast and Gigabit Ethernet (1000&nbsp;Mbit)
        adapters, improved support for the latest Adaptec controllers, and
        many thousands of bug fixes.</para>

      <para>In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a
        ported software collection with thousands of commonly
        sought-after programs.  At the time of this printing, there
        were over &os.numports; ports!  The list of ports ranges from
        http (WWW) servers, to games, languages, editors, and almost
        everything in between.  The entire ports collection requires
        approximately &ports.size; of storage, all ports being expressed as
        <quote>deltas</quote> to their original sources.  This makes
        it much easier for us to update ports, and greatly reduces the
        disk space demands made by the older 1.0 ports collection.  To
        compile a port, you simply change to the directory of the
        program you wish to install, type <command>make
        install</command>, and let the system do the rest.  The full
        original distribution for each port you build is retrieved
        dynamically off the CDROM or a local FTP site, so you need
        only enough disk space to build the ports you want.  Almost
        every port is also provided as a pre-compiled
        <quote>package</quote>, which can be installed with a simple
        command (<command>pkg_add</command>) by those who do not wish
        to compile their own ports from source.  More information on
	packages and ports can be found in <xref linkend="ports">.</para>

      <para>A number of additional documents which you may find very helpful
        in the process of installing and using FreeBSD may now also be found
