    <title>Porque Compilar um Kernel Personalisado?</title>

    <para>Tradicionalmente, &os; teve o que foi chamado de kernel
      <quote>monolitico</quote>. Isto significa que o kernel era um
      grande programa, contendo uma lista fixa de dispositivos suportados, e se voc&ecirc; quisesse
      alterar o comportamento do kernel ent&atilde;o &eacute; voc&ecirc; teria que compilar um novo kernel, e
      ent&atilde;o reiniciar seu computador com o novo kernel.</para>

    <para>Hoje, &os; est&aacute; movendo-se rapidamente para um modelo onde muitas das funcionalidades do
      kernel est&aacute; contida em m&oacute;dulos que s&atilde;o carregados e descarregados din&acirc;micamente do kernel conforme necess&aacute;rios.
      Isto permite que o kernel se adapte ao novo hardware que de-repente
      torna-se dispon&iacute;vel (tais como PCMCIA cart&otilde;es para laptop), ou para
      novas funcionalidades serem traduzidas dentro do kernel isso n&atilde;o era
      necess&aacute;rio quando o kernel era originalmente compilado. Sabemos que issos
      &eacute; um kernel modular. Coloquialmente eles s&atilde;o chamados KLDs.</para>

    <para>Despite this, it is still necessary to carry out some static kernel
      configuration.  In some cases this is because the functionality is so
      tied to the kernel that it can not be made dynamically loadable.  In
      others it may simply be because no one has yet taken the time to write a
      dynamic loadable kernel module for that functionality yet.</para>

    <para>Building a custom kernel is one of the most important rites of
      passage nearly every &unix; user must endure.  This process, while
      time consuming, will provide many benefits to your &os; system.
      Unlike the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which must support a
      wide range of hardware, a custom kernel only contains support for
      <emphasis>your</emphasis> PC's hardware.  This has a number of
      benefits, such as:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Faster boot time.  Since the kernel will only probe the
	hardware you have on your system, the time it takes your system to
	boot will decrease dramatically.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Less memory usage.  A custom kernel often uses less memory
	  than the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, which is important
	  because the kernel must always be present in real
	  memory.  For this reason, a custom kernel is especially useful
	  on a system with a small amount of RAM.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Additional hardware support.  A custom kernel allows you to
	  add in support for devices such as sound cards, which are not
	  present in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="kernelconfig-building">
    <title>Building and Installing a Custom Kernel</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>kernel</primary>
      <secondary>building / installing</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>First, let us take a quick tour of the kernel build directory.
      All directories mentioned will be relative to the main
      <filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory, which is also
      accessible through <filename>/sys</filename>.  There are a number of
      subdirectories here representing different parts of the kernel, but
      the most important, for our purposes, are
      <filename><replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename>, where you
      will edit your custom kernel configuration, and
      <filename>compile</filename>, which is the staging area where your
      kernel will be built.  <replaceable>arch</replaceable> represents
      either <filename>i386</filename>, <filename>alpha</filename>, or
      <filename>pc98</filename> (an alternative development branch of PC
      hardware, popular in Japan).  Everything inside a particular
      architecture's directory deals with that architecture only; the rest
      of the code is common to all platforms to which &os; could
      potentially be ported.  Notice the logical organization of the
      directory structure, with each supported device, file system, and
      option in its own subdirectory.  &os; 5.X and up has support for
      <filename>sparc64</filename>, and a few other architectures under
      development.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If there is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a
	<filename>/usr/src/sys</filename> directory on your system,
	then the kernel source has not been installed.  The easiest
	way to do this is by running
	<command>/stand/sysinstall</command> as
	<username>root</username>, choosing
	<guimenuitem>Configure</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>Distributions</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>src</guimenuitem>, then
	<guimenuitem>sys</guimenuitem>.  If you have an aversion to
	<application>sysinstall</application> and you have access to
	an <quote>official</quote> &os; CDROM, then you can also
	install the source from the command line:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /cdrom</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /usr/src/sys /sys</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cat /cdrom/src/ssys.[a-d]* | tar -xzvf -</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <para>Next, move to the
      <filename><replaceable>arch</replaceable>/conf</filename> directory
      and copy the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file to the
      name you want to give your kernel.  For example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>

    <para>Traditionally, this name is in all capital letters and, if you
      are maintaining multiple &os; machines with different hardware,
      it is a good idea to name it after your machine's hostname.  We will
      call it <filename>MYKERNEL</filename> for the purpose of this
      example.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Storing your kernel config file directly under
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> can be a bad idea.  If you are
	experiencing problems it can be tempting to just delete
	<filename>/usr/src</filename> and start again.  Five seconds after
	you do that you realize that you have deleted your custom kernel
	config file.  Do not edit <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	directly, as it may get overwritten the next time you
	<link linkend="cutting-edge">update your source tree</link>, and
	your kernel modifications will be lost.</para>

      <para>You might want to keep your kernel config file elsewhere, and then
	create a symbolic link to the file in the <filename>i386</filename>
	directory.</para>

      <para>For example:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /root/kernels</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cp GENERIC /root/kernels/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput>	
&prompt.root; <userinput>ln -s /root/kernels/<replaceable>MYKERNEL</replaceable></userinput></screen>
    </tip>

    <note>
      <para>You must execute these and all of the following commands under
	the <username>root</username> account or you will get
        <errortype>permission denied</errortype> errors.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Now, edit <filename>MYKERNEL</filename> with your favorite text
      editor.  If you are just starting out, the only editor available
      will probably be <application>vi</application>, which is too complex to
      explain here, but is covered well in many books in the <link
      linkend="bibliography">bibliography</link>.  However, &os; does
      offer an easier editor called <application>ee</application> which, if
      you are a beginner, should be your editor of choice.  Feel free to
      change the comment lines at the top to reflect your configuration or
      the changes you have made to differentiate it from
      <filename>GENERIC</filename>.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>SunOS</primary></indexterm>

    <para>If you have built a kernel under &sunos; or some other BSD
      operating system, much of this file will be very familiar to you.
      If you are coming from some other operating system such as DOS, on
      the other hand, the <filename>GENERIC</filename> configuration file
      might seem overwhelming to you, so follow the descriptions in the
      <link linkend="kernelconfig-config">Configuration File</link>
      section slowly and carefully.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Be sure to always check the file
        <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>, before you perform any update
        steps, in the case you <link
        linkend="cutting-edge">sync your source tree</link> with the
        latest sources of the &os; project.
        In this file all important issues with updating &os;
        are typed out.  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> always fits
        your version of the &os; source, and is therefore more accurate
        for new information than the handbook.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You must now compile the source code for the kernel.  There are two
      procedures you can use to do this, and the one you will use depends on
      why you are rebuilding the kernel, and the version of &os; you are
      running.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>If you have installed <emphasis>only</emphasis> the kernel
	  source code, use procedure 1.</para>

        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If you are building a new kernel without updating the source

    <note>
      <para>As of &os; 5.0, kernels are installed along with their

    <programlisting>machine		i386</programlisting>

    <para>This is the machine architecture.  It must be either
      <literal>i386</literal>, <literal>pc98</literal>,
      <literal>sparc64</literal>, <literal>alpha</literal>,

    <para>The above option specifies the type of CPU you have in your

      you are not sure whether you should use

      however, for a custom kernel, it is best to specify only the CPU

    <para>Support for <literal>I386_CPU</literal> is still provided in the

      instructions of the previous examples.  The value you put in the

    <programlisting>maxusers          <replaceable>n</replaceable></programlisting>

    <para>The <literal>maxusers</literal> option sets the size of a number
      of important system tables.  This number is supposed to be roughly
      equal to the number of simultaneous users you expect to have on your
      machine.</para>

    <para>Starting with &os;&nbsp;4.5, the system will auto-tune this setting
      for you if you explicitly set it to <literal>0</literal><footnote>
	<para>The auto-tuning algorithm sets <literal>maxuser</literal> equal
	  to the amount of memory in the system, with a minimum of 32, and a
	  maximum of 384.</para></footnote>.
      In &os;&nbsp;5.X, <literal>maxusers</literal> will default to
      <literal>0</literal> if not specified.  If you are using an
      version of &os; earlier than 4.5, or you want to manage it
      yourself you will want to set
      <literal>maxusers</literal> to at least 4, especially if you are
      using the X Window System or compiling software.  The reason is that
      the most important table set by <literal>maxusers</literal> is the
      maximum number of processes,  which is set to <literal>20 + 16 *
      maxusers</literal>, so if you set <literal>maxusers</literal> to 1,
      then you can only have 36 simultaneous processes, including the 18
      or so that the system starts up at boot time, and the 15 or so you
      will probably create when you start the X Window System.  Even a
      simple task like reading a manual page will start up nine processes to
      filter, decompress, and view it.  Setting
      <literal>maxusers</literal> to 64 will allow you to have up to 1044
      simultaneous processes, which should be enough for nearly all uses.
      If, however, you see the dreaded <errortype>proc table
      full</errortype> error when trying to start another program, or are
      running a server with a large number of simultaneous users (like
      <hostid role="fqdn">ftp.FreeBSD.org</hostid>), you can always
      increase the number and rebuild.</para>

    <note>
      <para><literal>maxusers</literal> does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
	limit the number of users which can log into your machine.  It
	simply sets various table sizes to reasonable values considering
	the maximum number of users you will likely have on your system
	and how many processes each of them will be running.  One keyword
	which <emphasis>does</emphasis> limit the number of simultaneous
	<emphasis>remote logins and X terminal windows</emphasis> is <link

    <para><literal>npx0</literal> is the interface to the floating point
      math unit in &os;, which is either the hardware co-processor or
      the software math emulator.  This is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      optional.</para>

    <programlisting># Pseudo devices - the number indicates how many units to allocate.
pseudo-device   loop          # Network loopback</programlisting>

    <para>This is the generic loopback device for TCP/IP.  If you telnet
      or FTP to <hostid>localhost</hostid> (a.k.a., <hostid
      role="ipaddr">127.0.0.1</hostid>) it will come back at you through
      this pseudo-device.  This is <emphasis>mandatory</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Everything that follows is more or less optional.  See the notes
      underneath or next to each option for more information.</para>

    <programlisting>#To statically compile in device wiring instead of /boot/device.hints
#hints          "GENERIC.hints"         #Default places to look for devices.</programlisting>

    <para>In &os; 5.X and newer versions the &man.device.hints.5; is
      used to configure options of the device drivers.  The default
      location that &man.loader.8; will check at boot time is
      <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>.  Using the
      <literal>hints</literal> option you can compile these hints
      statically into your kernel.  Then there is no need to create a
      <filename>device.hints</filename> file in
      <filename>/boot</filename>.</para>

    <!-- XXX: Add a comment here that explains when compiling hints into the kernel is a good idea and why. -->

    <programlisting>#makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          #Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols</programlisting>

    <para>The normal build process of the &os; does not include
      debugging information when building the kernel and strips most
      symbols after the resulting kernel is linked, to save some space
      at the install location.  If you are going to do tests of kernels
      in the -CURRENT branch or develop changes of your own for the &os;
      kernel, you might want to uncomment this line.  It will enable the
      use of the <option>-g</option> option which enables debugging
      information when passed to &man.gcc.1;.  The same can be
      accomplished by the &man.config.8; <option>-g</option> option, if
      you are using the <quote>traditional</quote> way for building your kernels (See the <xref linkend="kernelconfig-building">
      for more informations.).</para>

    <programlisting>options          MATH_EMULATE      #Support for x87 emulation</programlisting>

    <para>This line allows the kernel to simulate a math co-processor if
      your computer does not have one (386 or 486SX).  If you have a
      486DX, or a 386 or 486SX (with a separate 387 or 487 chip), or
      higher (&pentium;, &pentium;&nbsp;II, etc.), you can comment this line
      out.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The normal math co-processor emulation routines that come with
	&os; are <emphasis>not</emphasis> very accurate.  If you do not
	have a math co-processor, and you need the best accuracy, it is
	recommended that you change this option to
	<literal>GPL_MATH_EMULATE</literal> to use the GNU math support,
	which is not included by default for licensing reasons.</para>

      <para>In &os; 5.X, math emulation is disabled by default,
      as older CPUs that do not have native floating point math support
      are far less common, and in many cases not supported by the
      <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel without other additional options.</para></note>

    <programlisting>options          INET          #InterNETworking</programlisting>

    <para>Networking support.  Leave this in, even if you do not plan to
      be connected to a network.  Most programs require at least loopback
      networking (i.e., making network connections within your PC), so
      this is essentially mandatory.</para>

    <programlisting>options          INET6          #IPv6 communications protocols</programlisting>

    <para>This enables the IPv6 communication protocols.</para>

    <programlisting>options          FFS          #Berkeley Fast Filesystem
options          FFS_ROOT     #FFS usable as root device [keep this!]</programlisting>

    <para>This is the basic hard drive Filesystem.  Leave it in if you
      boot from the hard disk.</para>

    <note><para>In &os; 5.X, <literal>FFS_ROOT</literal> is no longer
      required.</para></note>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_ACL      #Support for access control lists</programlisting>

    <para>This option, present only in &os;&nbsp;5.X, enables kernel support
      for access control lists.  This relies on the use of extended
      attributes and <acronym>UFS2</acronym>, and the feature is described in detail
      in the <xref linkend="fs-acl">.  <acronym>ACL</acronym>s are enabled by default, and should not be
      disabled in the kernel if they have been used previously on a file
      system, as this will remove the access control lists changing the
      way files are protected in unpredictable ways.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UFS_DIRHASH  #Improve performance on big directories</programlisting>

    <para>This option includes functionality to speed up disk
      operations on large directories, at the expense of using
      additional memory.  You would normally keep this for a large
      server, or interactive workstation, and remove it if you are
      using &os; on a smaller system where memory is at a premium and
      disk access speed is less important, such as a firewall.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SOFTUPDATES  #Enable FFS Soft Updates support</programlisting>

    <para>This option enables Soft Updates in the kernel, this will
      help speed up write access on the disks.  Even when this
      functionality is provided by the kernel, it must be turned on
      for specific disks.  Review the output from &man.mount.8; to see
      if Soft Updates is enabled for your system disks.  If you do not
      see the <literal>soft-updates</literal> option then you will
      need to activate it using the &man.tunefs.8; (for existing
      filesystems) or &man.newfs.8; (for new filesystems)
      commands.</para>

    <programlisting>options          MFS          #Memory Filesystem
options          MD_ROOT      #MD is a potential root device</programlisting>

    <para>This is the memory-mapped Filesystem.  This is basically a RAM
      disk for fast storage of temporary files, useful if you have a lot
      of swap space that you want to take advantage of.  A perfect place
      to mount an MFS partition is on the <filename>/tmp</filename>
      directory, since many programs store temporary data here.  To mount
      an MFS RAM disk on <filename>/tmp</filename>, add the following line
      to <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>/dev/ad1s2b	/tmp mfs rw 0 0</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Now you simply need to either reboot, or run the command
      <command>mount /tmp</command>.</para>

    <note><para>In &os; 5.X, &man.md.4;-backed UFS file systems are
      used for memory file systems rather than MFS.  Information on
      configuring memory-backed file systems may be found in the manual pages
      for &man.mdconfig.8; and &man.mdmfs.8;, and in <xref linkend="disks-virtual">.  As a result, the
      <literal>MFS</literal> option is no longer supported.</para></note>

    <para>The &ms-dos; Filesystem.  Unless you plan to mount a DOS formatted
      hard drive partition at boot time, you can safely comment this out.
      It will be automatically loaded the first time you mount a DOS
      partition, as described above.  Also, the excellent
      <application>mtools</application> software (in the ports collection)
      allows you to access DOS floppies without having to mount and
      unmount them (and does not require <literal>MSDOSFS</literal> at
      all).</para>

options          CD9660_ROOT  #CD-ROM usable as root, CD9660 required</programlisting>

    <para>The ISO 9660 Filesystem for CDROMs.  Comment it out if you do
      not have a CDROM drive or only mount data CDs occasionally (since it
      will be dynamically loaded the first time you mount a data CD).
      Audio CDs do not need this Filesystem.</para>

    <programlisting>options          PROCFS       #Process filesystem</programlisting>

    <para>The process filesystem.  This is a <quote>pretend</quote>
      filesystem mounted on <filename>/proc</filename> which allows
      programs like &man.ps.1; to give you more information on what
      processes are running.  In &os; 5.X, use of <literal>PROCFS</literal>
      is not required under most circumstances, as most
      debugging and monitoring tools have been adapted to run without
      <literal>PROCFS</literal>.  In addition, 5.X-CURRENT kernels
      making use of <literal>PROCFS</literal> must now also include
      support for <literal>PSEUDOFS</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>options          PSEUDOFS     #Pseudo-filesystem framework</programlisting>

    <para><literal>PSEUDOFS</literal> is not available in &os; 4.X.
      Unlike in &os; 4.X, new installations of &os; 5.X will not mount
      the process file system by default.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_43    #Compatible with BSD 4.3 [KEEP THIS!]</programlisting>

    <para>Compatibility with 4.3BSD.  Leave this in; some programs will
      act strangely if you comment this out.</para>

    <programlisting>options          COMPAT_FREEBSD4     #Compatible with &os;4</programlisting>

    <para>This option is required on &os;&nbsp;5.X &i386; and Alpha systems
      to support applications compiled on older versions of &os;
      that use older system call interfaces.  It is recommended that
      this option be used on all &i386; and Alpha systems that may
      run older applications; platforms that gained support only in
      5.X, such as ia64 and &sparc64;, do not require this option.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SCSI_DELAY=15000    #Delay (in ms) before probing SCSI</programlisting>

    <para>This causes the kernel to pause for 15 seconds before probing
      each SCSI device in your system.  If you only have IDE hard drives,
      you can ignore this, otherwise you will probably want to lower this
      number, perhaps to 5 seconds, to speed up booting.  Of course, if
      you do this, and &os; has trouble recognizing your SCSI devices,
      you will have to raise it back up.</para>

    <programlisting>options          UCONSOLE            #Allow users to grab the console</programlisting>

    <para>Allow users to grab the console, which is useful for X users.
      For example, you can create a console <application>xterm</application>
      by typing <command>xterm
      -C</command>, which will display any &man.write.1;,
      &man.talk.1;, and any other messages you receive, as well
      as any console messages sent by the kernel.</para>

    <note><para>In &os; 5.X, <literal>UCONSOLE</literal> is no
      longer required.</para></note>

    <programlisting>options          USERCONFIG          #boot -c editor</programlisting>

    <programlisting>options          VISUAL_USERCONFIG   #visual boot -c editor</programlisting>

    <para>This option allows you to boot the visual configuration editor
      from the boot menu.</para>

      <note><para>From &os; versions 5.0 and later, the <literal>USERCONFIG</literal> options has
	been deprecated in favor of the new &man.device.hints.5;
	method.  For more information on &man.device.hints.5; please

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSHM             #SYSV-style shared memory</programlisting>

    <para>This option provides for System V shared memory.  The most
      common use of this is the XSHM extension in X, which many
      graphics-intensive programs will automatically take advantage of for
      extra speed.  If you use X, you will definitely want to include
      this.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVSEM             #SYSV-style semaphores</programlisting>

    <para>Support for System V semaphores.  Less commonly used but only
      adds a few hundred bytes to the kernel.</para>

    <programlisting>options          SYSVMSG             #SYSV-style message queues</programlisting>

    <para>Support for System V messages.  Again, only adds a few hundred
      bytes to the kernel.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you have an internal modem on COM4 and a serial port at

	<literal>0x*2e8</literal>, and since many cheap serial cards do
	not fully decode the 16-bit IO address space, they clash with
	these cards making the COM4 port practically unavailable.</para>

      <para>Each serial port is required to have a unique IRQ (unless you

    <note><para>If you are running &os;&nbsp;5.0 or later
      you can safely skip this section.  These versions use
      &man.devfs.5; to allocate device nodes transparently for the user.</para></note>

    <para>Almost every device in the kernel has a corresponding
      <quote>node</quote> entry in the <filename>/dev</filename> directory.
      These nodes look like regular files, but are actually special
      entries into the kernel which programs use to access the device.
      The shell script <filename>/dev/MAKEDEV</filename>, which is
      executed when you first install the operating system, creates
      nearly all of the device nodes supported.  However, it does not
      create <emphasis>all</emphasis> of them, so when you add support for
      a new device, it pays to make sure that the appropriate entries are
      in this directory, and if not, add them.  Here is a simple
      example:</para>

    <para>Suppose you add the IDE CD-ROM support to the kernel.  The line
      to add is:</para>

    <programlisting>device acd0</programlisting>

    <para>This means that you should look for some entries that start with
      <filename>acd0</filename> in the <filename>/dev</filename>
      directory, possibly followed by a letter, such as
      <literal>c</literal>, or preceded by the letter
      <literal>r</literal>, which means a <quote>raw</quote> device.  It
      turns out that those files are not there, so you must change to the
      <filename>/dev</filename> directory and type:</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><command>MAKEDEV</command></primary></indexterm>
    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV acd0</userinput></screen>

    <para>When this script finishes, you will find that there are now
      <filename>acd0c</filename> and <filename>racd0c</filename> entries
      in <filename>/dev</filename> so you know that it executed
      correctly.</para>

    <para>For sound cards, the following command creates the appropriate
      entries:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sh MAKEDEV snd0</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>When creating device nodes for devices such as sound cards, if
	other people have access to your machine, it may be desirable to
	protect the devices from outside access by adding them to the
	<filename>/etc/fbtab</filename> file.  See &man.fbtab.5; for more
	information.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Follow this simple procedure for any other
      non-<filename>GENERIC</filename>  devices which do not have
      entries.</para>

    <note>
      <para>All SCSI controllers use the same set of
	<filename>/dev</filename> entries, so you do not need to create
	these.  Also, network cards and SLIP/PPP pseudo-devices do not
	have entries in <filename>/dev</filename> at all, so you do not
	have to worry about these either.</para>

	  <para>If the &man.config.8; command fails when you
	    give it your kernel description, you have probably made a
	    simple error somewhere.  Fortunately,
	    &man.config.8; will print the line number that it
	    had trouble with, so you can quickly skip to it with
	    <application>vi</application>.  For example, if you see:</para>

	  <screen>config: line 17: syntax error</screen>

	  <para>You can skip to the problem in <application>vi</application> by
	    typing <command>17G</command> in command mode.  Make sure the
	    keyword is typed correctly, by comparing it to the
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel or another
	    reference.</para>

	<term><command>make</command> fails:</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If the <command>make</command> command fails, it usually
	    signals an error in your kernel description, but not severe
	    enough for &man.config.8; to catch it.  Again, look
	    over your configuration, and if you still cannot resolve the
	    problem, send mail to the &a.questions; with your kernel
	    configuration, and it should be diagnosed very quickly.</para>

	<term>Installing the new kernel fails:</term>
	
	<listitem>
	  <para>If the kernel compiled fine, but failed to install
	    (the <command>make install</command> or
	    <command>make installkernel</command> command failed),
	    the first thing to check is if your system is running at
	    securelevel 1 or higher (see &man.init.8;).  The kernel
	    installation tries to remove the immutable flag from
	    your kernel and set the immutable flag on the new one.
	    Since securelevel 1 or higher prevents unsetting the immutable
	    flag for any files on the system, the kernel installation needs
	    to be performed at securelevel 0 or lower.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>The kernel does not boot:<anchor
	  id="kernelconfig-noboot"></term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If your new kernel does not boot, or fails to
	    recognize your devices, do not panic!  Fortunately, &os; has
	    an excellent mechanism for recovering from incompatible
	    kernels.  Simply choose the kernel you want to boot from at
	    the &os; boot loader. You can access this when the system
	    counts down from 10.  Hit any key except for the
            <keycap>Enter</keycap> key, type <command>unload</command>
            and then type
	    <command>boot <replaceable>kernel.old</replaceable></command>,
            or the filename of any other kernel that will boot properly.
            When reconfiguring a kernel, it is always a good idea to keep
            a kernel that is known to work on hand.</para>

	  <para>After booting with a good kernel you can check over your
	    configuration file and try to build it again.  One helpful
	    resource is the <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> file
	    which records, among other things, all of the kernel messages
	    from every successful boot.  Also, the &man.dmesg.8; command
	    will print the kernel messages from the current boot.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you are having trouble building a kernel, make sure
	      to keep a <filename>GENERIC</filename>, or some other kernel
	      that is known to work on hand as a different name that will
	      not get erased on the next build.  You cannot rely on
	      <filename>kernel.old</filename> because when installing a
	      new kernel, <filename>kernel.old</filename> is overwritten
	      with the last installed kernel which may be non-functional.
	      Also, as soon as possible, move the working kernel to the
	      proper <filename>kernel</filename> location or commands such
	      as &man.ps.1; will not work properly.  The proper command to
	      <quote>unlock</quote> the kernel file that
	      <command>make</command> installs (in order to move another
	      kernel back permanently) is:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chflags noschg /kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>If you find you cannot do this, you are probably running
	      at a &man.securelevel.8; greater than zero.  Edit
	      <literal>kern_securelevel</literal> in
	      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and set it to
	      <literal>-1</literal>, then reboot.  You can change it back
	      to its previous setting when you are happy with your new
	      kernel.</para>

	    <para>And, if you want to <quote>lock</quote> your new kernel
	      into place, or any file for that matter, so that it cannot
	      be moved or tampered with:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>chflags schg /kernel</userinput></screen>

	    <para>In &os; 5.X, kernels are not installed with the
	    system immutable flag, so this is unlikely to be the source
	    of the problem you are experiencing.</para></note>

	<term>The kernel works, but &man.ps.1; does not work
	  any more:</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>If you have installed a different version of the kernel
	    from the one that the system utilities have been built with,
	    for example, a 4.X kernel on a 3.X system, many system-status
	    commands like &man.ps.1; and &man.vmstat.8; will not work any
	    more.  You must recompile the <filename>libkvm</filename>
	    library as well as these utilities.  This is one reason it is
	    not normally a good idea to use a different version of the
	    kernel from the rest of the operating system.</para>
